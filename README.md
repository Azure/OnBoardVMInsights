# On-Boarding for VM Insights - Private Preview
For any questions, to give feedback, or to have your workspace white-listed for the VM Insights Private Preview:
* email: vminsights@microsoft.com

This readme gives steps on how to On-Board to VM Insights using scripts and ARM templates.

To access VM Insights in Azure Monitor and the VM blade, go to https://aka.ms/vminsights.  You can on-board for a single VM from the VM blade under the "Insights" item in the table of contents.  The instructions below are for on-boarding at scale.

We can organize setup steps as follows:
- [Log Analytics Workspace setup](#log-analytics-workspace-setup)
- [Per VM and VM Scale Set setup](#per-vm-and-vm-scale-set-setup)

## Supported Log Analytics Workspace Regions

**Important!** Only Log Analytics Workspaces in following regions are supported:
* West Central US
* East US
* Southeast Asia (Health not supported yet)
* West Europe (Health not supported yet)

## Log Analytics Workspace setup
If you have already configured a single VM for VM Insights through UI experience, then these steps will already have been taken care of for you and you can move on to enabling for more VM's.

Summary of steps:
- Create a Log Analytics workspace in a [supported region](#supported-log-analytics-workspace-regions)
- Install the ServiceMap and InfrastructureInsights Solutions
- Configure the workspace to collect performance counters
- Configure the subscription to onboard to Health

#### Create a Log Analytics workspace in a supported region
See Log Analytics Documentation: [Create a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-quick-create-workspace)

Reminder, VM Insights [Supported Workspace regions](#supported-log-analytics-workspace-regions)

#### Install the ServiceMap and InfrastructureInsights Solutions
We have provided an ARM template [InstallSolutionsForVMInsights.json](InstallSolutionsForVMInsights.json) that will deploy the ServiceMap and InfrastructureInsights solutions to your Log Analytics workspace.

You can find information on how to deploy ARM templates [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy)
Example of deploying with PowerShell:
```powershell
New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name DeploySolutions -TemplateFile InstallSolutionsForVMInsights.json -ResourceGroupName <workspace resource group name> -WorkspaceName <workspace name> -WorkspaceLocation <workspace location- example: eastus>
```

You can also deploy directly from Azure Portal using <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdougbrad%2FOnBoardVMInsights%2Fmaster%2FInstallSolutionsForVMInsights.json" target="_blank">this link</a>
#### Configure the workspace to collect performance counters
Compute Performance provides summarized and per-resource views of key metrics for on-prem VMs, Azure VMs, VM Scale Sets, and cloud services.  

It is recommended you run [Enable-VMInsightsPerfCounters.ps1](Enable-VMInsightsPerfCounters.ps1) to configure your Log Analytics Workspace to collect the required counters.
To quickly download the powershell to your local filesystem, run following:
```powershell
$client = new-object System.Net.WebClient
$client.DownloadFile(“https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dougbrad/OnBoardVMInsights/master/Enable-VMInsightsPerfCounters.ps1”,“Enable-VMInsightsPerfCounters.ps1”) 
``` 
Enable-VMInsightsPerfCounters.ps1 takes two parameters
```powershell
    -WorkspaceName <String>
        Name of Log Analytics Workspace to configure

    -WorkspaceResourceGroupName <String>
        Resource Group the Log Analytics Workspace is in
```
Example:
```powershell
.\Enable-VMInsightsPerfCounters.ps1 -WorkspaceName <Name of Workspace> -WorkspaceResourceGroupName <Workspace Resource Group>
```
Below is a list of Performance Counters that are configured to be collected:
Note: the collection interval for any newly added configuration is set to 60 seconds

**Windows**

| Object Name | Instance Name | Counter Name |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| LogicalDisk | * | % Free Space |
| LogicalDisk | * | Avg. Disk sec/Read |
| LogicalDisk | * | Avg. Disk sec/Transfer |

For more info on Log Analytics Performance Counters, see:
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-data-sources-performance-counters

## Per VM and VM Scale Set setup

On each VM or VM Scale Set the following is needed
- Log Analytics VM Extension pointing to a workspace in a [supported region](#supported-log-analytics-workspace-regions)
- Dependency Agent VM Extension

For the private preview we are providing a script [Install-VMInsights.ps1](Install-VMInsights.ps1) to accomplish this.

To quickly download the powershell to your local filesystem, run following:
```powershell
$client = new-object System.Net.WebClient
$client.DownloadFile(“https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dougbrad/OnBoardVMInsights/master/Install-VMInsights.ps1”,“Install-VMInsights.ps1”) 
``` 

This script will iterate through VM's and VM Scale sets in a Subcription, or further scoped by ResourceGroup or Name.
For each VM or VM ScaleSet it will check the currently installed VM extensions and install if needed.

This script requires Azure PowerShell, you can find instructions to install for Windows at [Install Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps?view=azurermps-6.5.0)



You can run Get-Help to get details and an example of usage:

```powershell
Get-Help .\Install-VMInsights.ps1 -Detailed

## Onboarding a PaaS v1 Cloud Service to VM Insights

1.	Get workspace id and workspace key which will be used in the following steps 
2.	Edit the ServiceDefinition.csdef file of your cloud service and add the following two settings:
```powershell
      <Setting name="WorkspaceId" />
      <Setting name="WorkspaceKey" />
```
3.	Add install-mma-and-da.cmd and install-mma-and-da.ps1 to your project. The files, as provided, assume that they will be placed at the root of the Cloud Service project. If you wish to relocate them you must update the provided install-mma-and-da.cmd file and the snippet shown below in step 6.
4.	Add a startup task to you ServiceDefinition.csdef to execute install-mma-and-da.cmd with the correct arguments:
```powershell
      <Task commandLine="install-mma-and-da.cmd" executionContext="elevated" taskType="simple">
        <Environment>
          <Variable name="IsEmulated">
            <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated" />
          </Variable>
          <Variable name="WorkspaceId">
            <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/ConfigurationSettings/ConfigurationSetting[@name='WorkspaceId']/@value" />
          </Variable>
          <Variable name="WorkspaceKey">
            <RoleInstanceValue xpath="/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/ConfigurationSettings/ConfigurationSetting[@name='WorkspaceKey']/@value" />
          </Variable>
        </Environment>
      </Task>
```
5.	Update the cscfg file(s) supplying values for these settings
6.	Build and deploy your service
